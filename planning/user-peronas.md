# User Persona John Smith

- **Bio**:
- John Smith is a 35-year-old professional working in the finance industry. He
  leads a busy life managing multiple projects and tasks on a daily basis. As
  someone who values organization and productivity, John is always on the
  lookout for tools and strategies to help him stay on top of his workload.

- **Needs/Goals**:
- John needs a reliable todo list application that allows him to quickly add new
  tasks and manage his existing ones efficiently. He wants the ability to easily
  prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and mark them as complete to track his
  progress. John also values simplicity and user-friendliness in the application
  interface, as he doesn't have time to deal with complicated tools.

- **Frustrations**:
- John finds it frustrating when todo list applications are cluttered with
  unnecessary features or have a steep learning curve. He is annoyed by
  applications that are slow or prone to crashing, as this disrupts his workflow
  and wastes valuable time. John is also frustrated when he accidentally deletes
  important tasks or encounters bugs that cause data loss.

- **Scenario 1**:
- John starts his workday by opening his todo list application to plan his tasks
  for the day. He adds new items to the list by typing them into the input field
  and clicking the "Add" button. Throughout the day, John checks off tasks as he
  completes them and occasionally deletes tasks that are no longer relevant. At
  the end of the day, John feels satisfied with his productivity and looks
  forward to using the todo list application again tomorrow.
